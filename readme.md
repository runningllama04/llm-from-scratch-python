1. **Introduction**
   - Understand the importance of language models.
   - Explore real-world applications.
2. **Data Handling**
   - Learn character-level tokenization.
   - Work with tensors for efficient data representation.
3. **Model Creation**
   - Split data into train and validation sets.
   - Build a bigram language model.
   - Understand inputs and targets.
4. **PyTorch Framework**
   - Introduction to PyTorch.
   - Switch between CPU and GPU processing.
   - Implement basic operations using PyTorch.
5. **Transformer Architectures**
   - Dive into self-attention mechanisms.
   - Build and train your own GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model.
6. **Real-World Applications**
   - Train your model on specific datasets.
   - Optimize memory usage.
   - Load and save your trained language model.
